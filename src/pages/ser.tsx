      <Section title="Overview">
        <p>
          Ser Digital explored how the university experience could evolve around
          students' changing needs, connecting customer experience, technology,
          innovation, and organizational transformation.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was not a project about designing a single product. The challenge
          was to define how an entire ecosystem of services could work together
          to create a more coherent and meaningful relationship with students.

      <Section title="The challenge">
        <p>
          A student's university experience is much bigger than attending

        <Quote>
          But the services supporting that experience don't always feel like one
          connected journey.
        </Quote>

        <p>
          Students navigate academic, administrative, financial, professional,
          and social aspects of university throughout their lives as students.
          Each of these moments can involve different processes, teams, and
          channels.
        </p>

        <p>
          The challenge was to understand the factors that negatively impacted 
          student experiences and led to dropout. The goal was to move beyond 
          isolated improvements and establish a coherent experience strategy that could guide future services and investments across the ecosystem.

          A key part of the work was recognizing that the student population
          could not be treated as a single audience.

        <p>
          Students arrive with different motivations, levels of direction, and

        </p>

        <StudentMindsetMatrix />

        <p>
          This gave us a more useful lens for thinking about experience design:
          rather than asking what a generic student needs, we could consider how
          different relationships with education might require different kinds of
          support.

          Together, they created a framework for thinking about the evolution of

      <Section title="Building a stronger foundation first">
        <p>
          Experience transformation needed to begin with the basics. Before
          introducing new forms of value, students needed a simpler and more
          reliable way to manage their everyday university lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          This included opportunities to create more unified access to academic
          information, simplify service requests, improve support, and evolve
          the mobile and digital experience.
